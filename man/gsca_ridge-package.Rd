\title{
GSCA with Ridge Regularization Implementation
}
\description{
This package provides a complete implementation of Generalized Structured Component
Analysis (GSCA) with Ridge regularization for structural equation modeling.
The implementation follows the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) procedure with
Ridge penalty for improved stability and reduced multicollinearity.
}
\details{
The package implements GSCA with Ridge regularization for structural equation modeling.
It provides functions to:
\itemize{
  \item Define measurement and structural models
  \item Estimate model parameters with Ridge regularization
  \item Assess model fit and reliability
  \item Validate results through bootstrapping
  \item Check multivariate outliers using Mahalanobis distance
}

\note{
This package was developed as part of a paper revisiting with IA the doctoral thesis "Do ICT's deep use increase hotel's staff productivity and guest satisfaction?" supervised by Dr. Andr√©s Artal Tur at the Technical University of Cartagena, in order to compare human vs IA, and the IA needed to create this new package to try to improve previous human model.

The implementation was created to provide a transparent, open-source alternative to proprietary GSCA software, enabling reproducible research in structural equation modeling with improved stability through Ridge regularization.
