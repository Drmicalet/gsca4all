 **Mahalanobis Distance Outlier Detection: What It Does and Why It's Important**

The Mahalanobis distance is a multivariate statistical measure used to identify outliers—data points that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset. Unlike simple Euclidean distance, which only considers the absolute difference between points, the Mahalanobis distance accounts for correlations between variables and scales the data based on its covariance structure.

#### **What It Does in This Package**

1.   **Calculates Multivariate Distance** 

     For each observation (e.g., each hotel staff member’s responses), the function computes how far it lies from the centroid (mean) of all observations, adjusted by the covariance matrix of the data:

     *D*2=(*x*−*μ*)*T*Σ−1(*x*−*μ*)

     where:

     -    *x* is the vector of observed values,
     -    *μ* is the mean vector of the sample,
     -    Σ is the covariance matrix.

2.   **Sets a Critical Threshold at 99.9% Confidence Level**
     The critical value is derived from the chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of indicators (variables). At α = 0.001 (99.9% confidence), any observation with a Mahalanobis distance exceeding this threshold is flagged as an extreme multivariate outlier.

3.   **Identifies Outlier Cases**
     Returns a list of case IDs or row indices that are statistically extreme, allowing researchers to inspect them individually (e.g., check for data entry errors, unique behavioral patterns).

4.   **Reports Percentage of Outliers**
     Provides the proportion of the total sample identified as outliers, helping assess data quality and potential bias.

5.   **Supports Sensitivity Analysis via Automatic Removal Option**
     Although not removing outliers automatically by default, the package enables users to re-run models with and without detected outliers to evaluate their impact on key results (e.g., path coefficients, FIT index). This ensures robustness and replicability.

#### **Why It's Important in GSCA-SEM Modeling**

**Protects Against Model Distortion**
A single multivariate outlier can disproportionately influence parameter estimates (loadings, path coefficients), leading to misleading conclusions. By detecting these cases, the model remains stable and representative.

**Ensures Validity of Assumptions**
Structural equation modeling assumes multivariate normality. Outliers violate this assumption, inflating variances and distorting relationships. Identifying them allows researchers to address violations appropriately (e.g., transformation, robust estimation, or justified removal).

**Improves Reliability and Reproducibility**
Transparent reporting of outlier detection and handling aligns with best practices in open science. It enhances trust in findings by showing that results are not driven by anomalous data points.

**Supports Ethical Data Practices**
Rather than silently ignoring problematic data, explicit outlier analysis encourages responsible decision-making. Researchers can document whether outliers were due to measurement error, rare but valid phenomena, or sampling anomalies.

**Enhances Model Fit and Interpretation**
Removing or adjusting for influential outliers often improves fit indices (e.g., SRMR, FIT), making the theoretical model more congruent with the empirical data.

#### **Example in Context**

In our study of 190 hotel staff members, suppose one respondent reported extremely high use of all ICT tools but very low productivity, a pattern inconsistent with the overall correlation structure. Without Mahalanobis screening, this point could artificially weaken the `Knowledge → Productivity` path. With it, we detect and evaluate this case, ensuring our conclusion about ICT's impact is reliable.

By integrating Mahalanobis distance testing directly into the `gsca_ridge` output, the package promotes rigorous, transparent, and reproducible structural equation modeling, key pillars of scientific integrity.
