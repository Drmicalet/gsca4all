Title: Generalized Structured Component Analysis with Elastic Net Regularization
Version: 1.1.0
Authors@R: c(person("Miguel", "Mayol-Tur", email = "m00mayoltur@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: Implements Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GSCA) with Elastic Net regularization (Ridge, Lasso, and mixtures) for structural equation modeling. The package provides tools for estimating model parameters with improved stability through regularization, following the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) procedure. Suitable for composite-based SEM in social sciences, hospitality research, and other fields requiring robust latent variable modeling.
