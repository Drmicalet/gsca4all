Description: Implements Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GSCA) with Ridge regularization 
  for structural equation modeling. The package provides tools for estimating model parameters 
  with improved stability through Ridge penalty, following the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) 
  procedure. Suitable for composite-based SEM in social sciences, hospitality research, and 
  other fields requiring robust latent variable modeling.
